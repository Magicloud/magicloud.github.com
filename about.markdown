I am a not so smart Rust programmer, a Devops engineer have not worked on large clusters, a Linux system engineer focused on customizing OS and repacking.

I currently have 30 cats, used to have more. But things happens, sometimes it is my fault, sometimes it is fate.

I am unemployeed right now, so trying to work some Yolo thing to help identifying the ingesting situation of cats.
