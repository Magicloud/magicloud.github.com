I am a not so smart Rust programmer, a Devops engineer without large scale experience, a Linux system engineer never worked with LVS.

I currently have 30 cats, used to have more. But things happens, sometimes it is my fault, sometimes it is fate.

I am unemployeed right now, so trying to work some Yolo thing to help identifying the ingesting situation of cats.
